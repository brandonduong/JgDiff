# JgDiff

## Introduction ##
JgDiff is a webapp for one of my favourite games, 
[**League of Legends**](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/), with the goal of
aiding players such that they see an increase in their percentage of victory.

## Features ##
JgDiff is primarily used to calculate early game matchups in the roles of Top, Jungle,
Mid, Adc, and Support. This allows users to better understand their team's strength in
early skirmishes whether they be 1v1s, 2v2s, etc. Not only that, but this information
can be used to predict which lanes will have lane priority, of which is essential for
junglers trying to secure Scuttle Crab, invade the enemy jungle, or just apply
pressure overall.

With this information, users can have confidence in their decision making and adapt
their early pathing and playstyle to ensure a dominant victory.

## Usage ##
* Simply visit [**JgDiff**](http://branduong.pythonanywhere.com/champselect/) and select two champions and click "Calculate".
* Wait for JgDiff to calculate the results (may take up to 1 minutes depending on sample size!)
* Results will then be displayed onscreen!

## Future! ##
* Currently only takes into account the North American server (all ranked games), therefore hope to implement an option to change to the 
Korean and European servers soon.
* As more matches are added to the database, the longer the loading time, therefore hope to implement a faster
algorithm + loading screen when waiting for results.
